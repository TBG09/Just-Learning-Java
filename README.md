# Just-Learning-Java
Just an open source repo to keep my project and let anybody look at the src.

This project was made using Intelij idea community(although I don't think the edition matters)
Anyways yea, if you want to use this just provide credit(I bet you won't anyway)

If you are wondering where the other releases are... they are gone, meh, who needs those old versions anyway?


**If you want help with arguments then just put the argument help at the end.**
**No arguments will just run the program as normal.**


**Main branch is always latest**
